    "This competition focuses on the problem of forecasting the future values of multiple time series, as it has always been one of the most challenging problems in the field. More specifically, we aim the competition at testing state-of-the-art methods designed by the participants, on the problem of forecasting future web traffic for approximately 145,000 Wikipedia articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential or temporal observations emerge in many key real-world problems, ranging from biological data, financial markets, weather forecasting, to audio and video processing. The field of time series encapsulates many different problems, ranging from analysis and inference to classification and forecast. What can you do to help predict future views?\n",
    "\n",
    "You have complete freedom in how to produce your forecasts: e.g. use of univariate vs multi-variate models, use of metadata (article identifier), hierarchical time series modeling (for different types of traffic), data augmentation (e.g. using Google Trends data to extend the dataset), anomaly and outlier detection and cleaning, different strategies for missing value imputation, and many more types of approaches.\n",

Each of these time series represent a number of daily views of a different Wikipedia article, starting from July, 1st, 2015 up until December 31st, 2016. The leaderboard during the training stage is based on traffic from January, 1st, 2017 up until March 1st, 2017.\n",

    "The second stage will use training data up until September 1st, 2017. The final ranking of the competition will be based on predictions of daily views between September 13th, 2017 and November 13th, 2017 for each article in the dataset. You will submit your forecasts for these dates by September 12th.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each time series, you are provided the name of the article as well as the type of traffic that this time series represent (all, mobile, desktop, spider). You may use this metadata and any other publicly available data to make predictions. Unfortunately, the data source for this dataset does not distinguish between traffic values of zero and missing values. A missing value may mean the traffic was zero or that the data is not available for that day.\n",

The page names contain the Wikipedia project (e.g. en.wikipedia.org), type of access (e.g. desktop) and type of agent (e.g. spider).
